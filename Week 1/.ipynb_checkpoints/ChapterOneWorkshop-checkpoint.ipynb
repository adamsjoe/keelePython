Thus far, this text has been presented in Markdown within a **Markdown Cell**. Remember that you can add a new cell with the **menu item** Insert (cell below or above). You can split a cell at the cursor point with **Edit-Split Cell**. You can change a code cell to a markdown cell using **ESC-m** and a markdown cell to a code cell using **ESC-y**. Jupyter and Markdown guides can be found within the Resources folder - but dont spend too much time on them at present. Focus on the basics.\n",

To run the cell, click within it to select it and then click on the Run icon in the toolbar below the menu at the top of the page  - or press SHIFT-ENTER. A **Syntax Error** will be reported with some additional information - **unexpected EOF while parsing**. Parsing is the process of turning a program into a form which the Python language can execute. As a **formal** language, Python has strict syntactic rules. An opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket AND the arguments required by the **print** function must be enclosed in brackets (parentheses). The EOF stands for 'End Of File'. Python normally accepts a program from a file. It searched to the end of the file (the cell in this case) for a corresponding closing bracket and was unable to find one. Syntax errors can occur in less formal languages as well. Consider \"I an ice cream.\" Here it is slightly more ambiguous. The author could be making some philosophical statement or more probably simply ommitted a verb. Happily, in computing syntactic errors are usually easy for the parser to detect.\n",
