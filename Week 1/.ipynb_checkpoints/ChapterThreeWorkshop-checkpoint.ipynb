    "When you declare a function with **def** you are creating a function object with the name that you provide for the function. So, for example:\n",

    "def show(s):\n",
    "    print(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "creates a function called **show**. To call the function we would use its name, add brackets and any required arguments inside the brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def show(s):\n",
    "    print(s)\n",
    "show(\"Good Morning\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "A function can be passed another function in the following manner:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def doit(f,s):\n",
    "    f(s)\n",
    "    \n",
    "def show(s):\n",
    "    print(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "doit(show,\"Good Night\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a function can have a function as a parameter. In the example, the function **doit** is being passed the name of a function (**f**) and a string (**s**). **doit** then calls function **f** which is in fact the function **show** with the argument **s**. This can be difficult to understand at first. Play around with the following cell and ensure that you understand it before you proceed to the next exercise:"
