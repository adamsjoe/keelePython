# Dictionaries in Python are Mutable. Dictionaries are passed to functions by reference.

# A dictionary dict is declared as:

# dict={'Andrew':5, 'Brian':3, 'Clive':2, 'David':4}
# it contains the names of volunteers and the number of times that they have volunteered for a particular duty. The dictionary is regularly updated by providing both the dictionary and a list to a function upd.

# For the current update the following list has been declared - each name represents a new volunteer session:

# ulist = ['Brian', 'David', 'Peter']

# Write and demonstrate the function upd.
