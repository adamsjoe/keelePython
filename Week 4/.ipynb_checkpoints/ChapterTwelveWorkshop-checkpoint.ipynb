    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Downey book Sets are not considered until the final Chapter. However, I feel that they are sufficiently important to examine them now. You have probably come across sets in mathematics. It is a collection that is neither indexed nor ordered and hence we are primarily concerned with *membership* of a set. Sets, like dictionaries use the {} brackets to represent the set. However, unlike a dictionary, sets have no values, merely keys. Sets are immutable but you can add new items using the set's add() or update() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics we are generally interested in the relationship between different sets. The **union** of two sets is a set containing all of the items present in the two sets. Note that you cannot (mathematically) have duplicates in a set, each item is unique. The set's `union()` method performs this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **difference** between two sets is a set containing items that are not in BOTH sets. A `difference()` method is provided.\n",
    "The **intersection** of two sets is the set of items that are in BOTH sets. An `intersection()` method is provided. Lets look at some simple examples which should illustrate what Sets are all about!"

The important difference is that tuples are immutable. We cannot modify an item in a tuple - much like strings. Tuples have some powerful features. Downey has sections on Tuple assignment and Tuple function results. Both are important. Because a Tuple is a sequence, all of the operators and methods appropriate to a sequence are available for a tuple.\n",
